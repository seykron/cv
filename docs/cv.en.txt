About me
--------

I am a software engineer with more than ten years of experience in the
software industry. I am a senior developer specialized in web
applications. I developed web sites, classic request/response
applications, rich applications with heavy UX and components, backend
services, infrastructure services like queues and caches, business
intelligence and data processing applications, among others. I worked
with different architectures such as web services (SOAP), microservices
(REST), web sockets, classic request/response (MVC, streaming), among
others. I have experience with third party APIs and data sources
integration.

Regarding backend development, I worked with several stacks of
frameworks in ~~PHP~~, Java, Scala, Kotlin and NodeJS. Some problems I
have solved are user and API authentication, session management,
transactions, data access, free text search, asynchronous services
interoperability, static resources management and compression
(JavaScript, CSS, images, videos, etc.), language support,
geolocalization, processing and data clustering, content storage,
application and data security, among others.

Regarding frontend development, I think it is more important the
software design than mastering specific frameworks. Some problems I have
solved are the design of reusable components, optimization of resources
focused on user experience, cross-domain operations management,
customization, user-based features, state management and persistence,
language support, among others. I have worked with frameworks and
utilities such as jQuery, underscore.js, backbone, angularjs,
knockoutjs, jqueryUI, and lessCSS.

I endorse team work and quality assurance practices in order to build
good products. I usually build solutions based on software architecture
principles, good practices and conventions. I think that good
communication and peer review of code and architecture are some keys for
building common knowledge and a good product.

I support the free software philosophy. I am involved in the free
software community and I try to contribute whenever possible. In my free
time I build social-oriented software like open government, social
organization, and decision making software.

Experience in Software Development
----------------------------------

### Freelance (2004 - 2006)

My first jobs were as freelance programmer. Some projects to mention are
the corporative website for Labyes Laboratory and a Visual Basic-based
travel management system for a local rent-a-car shop. I developed
several sites by using Wordpress and Drupal.

*Technologies: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Basic, MS Access,
Symfony 1.0*

### Netic infoservicios (2006)

After finishing middle-school I worked as a Visual Basic programmer for
a small company writing software for search engine optimization (SEO). I
had to solve several architecture and distribution problems. The product
was a static site generator. It consisted of several applications, each
one in charge of generating part of the static site. This suite was
distributed as a self-contained installation package.

*Technologies: Visual Basic, MS Access,
[NSIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System)*

### W3americas (2006 - 2007)

My next job was for W3, a system consulting company focused on web
development and sites maintenance for third party customers. I worked on
the progressive maintenance of Citibank Brasil website. I was involved
in the site's full redesign, mainly developing components that required
integration with third- party services like stock exchange tables and
currency values, among others. I worked with Perl programming language
to automate deployments within a proprietary deployment management
software. It was a challenge to build cross-browser features since there
were very few tools (jQuery was at its early phase).

It was my first direct experience with customers, since I often had to
coordinate tasks with them. In my free time I learned Java web
applications development.

*Technologies: SourceSafe, Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript*

### CDA (2007 - 2009)

After leaving W3 I worked as a Java programmer for CDA, an HR consulting
company. I was involved in the development of internal HR systems such
as admissions, retirements, vacations, etc. I learned a lot about HR
processes. Some challenges were the integration of several databases,
the validation of consistency among different data sources, and learning
Adoble Flex since it was a requirement to develop the frontend by using
this technology. I developed the backend with Java 1.6, Struts MVC and
web services in the application layer, and Ibatis in the data access
layer.

I also had the chance to bootstrap a new project for a local bank. It
was an administrative audit software that implemented SOX controls in
order to ensure internal processes accountability. Some challenges were
working with Java 1.4, a database without data integrity check support
(a legacy version of Sybase), and a programming model required by the
bank based on stored procedures. I developed the frontend using JSP. I
learned about technical management, and I solved infrastructure problems
such as data access, storage and packaging and distribution of Java
applications.

*Technologies: SVN, Ant, Java EE (v1.4/1.6 + Web Services), Sybase DB,
Ibatis, Struts, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flex (ActionScript 3,
Cairngorm), Websphere*

### Globant (2009 - 2013)

My next job was for Globant, another HR consulting company. I worked as
web developer for JWT, a media agency specializing in marketing and
communication. The project consisted of a complete re-engineering of a
content management system. The product was a content manager to organize
digital content like documents, images and videos. It was designed to
allow the agency to customize the application for different customers.
The agency was able to re-brand the application and define storage and
processing quota for its customers.

In this project I learned to work with a service-oriented programming
model, since most of the application's responsibility was managed by the
frontend. The backend was build using Spring MVC and Jawr for services,
JackRabbit for content management, Hibernate to manage the domain model,
and FFMpeg/ImageMagick to process videos and images. The view rendering
used the freemarker template engine. In the frontend, I used jQuery for
DOM, YahooUI for rich components, and underscore.js for utilities.

I had my first experience bootstraping an application and managing a
development team in another project for JWT. The customer wanted to
integrate agencies from all over the world in order to share their work
and get to know them. We built a social network of marketing projects so
agencies were able to present creative ideas from anywhere for a project
created by another agency. The goal was to promote the interaction
between agencies in order to build common knowledge and reduce
redundancy and costs of content. My role in the project kick off was to
estimate the effort, set up the infrastructure, and agree with the
customer how to manage the project's follow-up and delivery.

After two years working for JWT, I started working for 55social, another
Globant's customer. The challenge was the creation of a social media
platform to allow companies manage content and marketing campaigns in
social networks. Thanks to a small high-performance team the first beta
was ready in four months. After two years of development, I left Globant
and I continued working for 55social.

*Technologies: SVN, GIT, Maven, Java EE, MySQL, JackRabbit, Hibernate,
Spring MVC, jawr, Freemarker, YahooUI, AWS, ImageMagick, FFMPeg*

### 55Social (2013-2015)

55social was a digital marketing company with operations in Brasil. The
product consisted of a content manager to create and publish marketing
campaigns on Facebook, a community management module to manage multiple
social networks accounts, and a metrics engine integrated with Facebook
and Google Analytics to analyze the outcome of marketing campaigns.

I worked as developer frontend and backend in the content manager and
the metrics engine, respectively. In the frontend the challenge was the
generation of a customizable design environment to allow marketing
agents building a Facebook campaign only by configuring a set of
widgets. Regarding the backend, the challenge was the creation of a
metrics engine able to extract and process data to display different
kind of graphs in order to allow customers analyze the outcome of
marketing campaigns.

While working on 55social and Globant I was an interviewer and I
prepared technical workshops and trainings about web development.

*Technologies: GIT, Maven, Java EE, Hibernate, Spring MVC,
[Katari](https://github.com/katari/Katari), Elastic Search, Freemarker,
Social APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus), jQuery UI,
[Histone](https://github.com/MegafonWebLab/histone-javascript),
[OOCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOCSS), AWS*

### Despegar.com (since 2015)

Despegar.com is an online travel agency. I work in backend programming
developing microservices.

The first two years I worked with flight selling. I had to rewrite the
flight booking engine in Scala. Some challenges were learning the Scala
programming language, the interoperability within the complex booking
flow, and the optimization of the application in order to support the
selling throughput.

I currently work in flights post-sales. I'm involved in the development
of several applications to detect and process involuntary flight
changes. Some challenges are processing asynchronous flow of involuntary
changes (flight providers notifies involuntary changes asynchronously),
the errors management and recovery, and the analysis of providers data
(since data consistency from providers is eventual and it depends on
airlines).

*Technologies: GIT, Maven, Spring MVC, Java Spark Web, Cassandra,
RabbitMQ, SBT, Java, Scala, Kotlin.*

### Free software

I have developed, maintained and collaborated in different free software
projects for many years. The logic behind a free software organization
is quite different from the business logic, so the experience managing
both kind of projects helped me to develop a critical view of
leadership, mainly oriented to problem solving through collaboration.
Many of the projects I started no longer exist, but there are a couple
of them that still are published on Github and I would like to comment
on the ones I consider more relevant.

#### I stop it (Yo los paro)

[Yo los paro](http://yolosparo.org) is a campaign to warn people about
irregularities in the new argentinian Fuel Law that was finally approved
in 2014. The campaign goal was to promote people's direct participation,
so they could send messages to the national legislatives without any
kind of registration. The long-term goal is to transform this single
campaign into a [direct participation
platform](https://github.com/piratas-%20ar/yolosparo/tree/feature/support-%20multiple-campaigns).

#### Argentine congress data importer

[ogov-importer](https://github.com/seykron/ogov-importer) retrieves all
bills and their votes from the Argentine National Congress since 2001
until nowadays, the list of current legislatives and the committees'
meetings and agendas, among other things. The importer is generic and it
is designed to make a fast and efficient crawling of any site.
