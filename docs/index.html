      <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
      <p>I am a software developer with more than ten years experience designing web solutions. I worked with both backend and frontend technologies such as PHP, Java, NodeJS, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Flex (ActionScript 3). I also worked with different data storage technologies like Sybase, MySQL, HSQLDB, Sqlite, MongoDB, JackRabbit; key-value indexes and caches like Redis, Elastic Search and Memcached. I was involved in the design and development of several systems related to content management, social networks, advertising and data analysis. I appreciate team working and everything related to it: developing based on design principles and good practices, making peer reviews, building common knowledge, adopting organization methodologies when it is required. I think that putting people over processes is the key to success, that's because I usually push to implement lean development when possible.</p>
      <p>I support the free software philosophy. I am involved in the free software community and I try to use and contribute to free software when possible. In my free time I develop social tools to encourage government transparency, people organization and group decision making. I study Social and Cultural Anthropology at National University of San Martín and I developed several tools as part of my researches on social movements and politics.</p>

      <h2 id="about-me-1">About me</h2>
      <p>I was raised in Mataderos, City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. When I was ten I received my first computer: a Pentium 386 with Windows 3.11. Since then computing was one of my main activities together with electronics. My family gave me a new computer when I finished primary school: an AMD-K6-2 500MHz. That year I started the electronics-oriented middle school and there was a teacher that gave me a full version of Visual Basic 6, so I started programming as a hobby.</p>
      <p>When I was sixteen I was working in a cybercafe at night and I took advantage of the free time to get involved with free software and web development. I was working in the cybercafe for two years till I finished middle school and during that time I also got involved in infrastructure, computer security and low-level development by using microcontrollers. I had some minor jobs as a freelance developer, including creating coorporative websites and a travel management system for a rent-a-car shop.</p>
      <p>Another of my interests during the middle school were reading, writing and philosophy. Indeed, I participated in philosophy competitions and I used to write a blog where I met a lot of people with similar interests. When I finished middle school I decided to continue working in software development since it was my hobby and occupation. At the same time my curiosity about human beings encouraged me to start a university carrier aligned to my other passions: writing and studying cultures as an expression of human experience.</p>
      <p>However, I deferred the humanities career some years in order to learn and focus on software development as my main profession. Finally, after a couple of years I started the career Social and Cultural Anthropology at the National University of San Martín. This career strengthens my other interests: travelling to new places, talking to people in order to get to know how they live, learning about popular art as the expression of people's morality, singing and dancing, among others.</p>
      <p>Nowadays all these activities complement my passion for software development and they are translated into the software development for organizations and social movements engaged with the communities' real problems.</p>

      <h3 id="freelance-2004---2006">Freelance (2004 - 2006)</h3>
      <h5 id="technologies-php-html-css-javascript-visual-basic-ms-access-symfony-1.0"><em>Technologies: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Basic, MS Access, Symfony 1.0</em></h5>
      <p>My first jobs were as a freelance programmer. Some projects to mention are the coorporative website for the Labyes Laboratory and a travel management system for a rent-a-car shop developed in Visual Basic. At the same time I was also developing several sites by using Wordpress and Drupal.</p>

      <h5 id="technologies-visual-basic-ms-access-nsis"><em>Technologies: Visual Basic, MS Access, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System">NSIS</a></em></h5>
      <p>After finishing middle-school I started working as a Visual Basic programmer at a very small business which had a product that consisted in performing search engine optimizations (SEO). I was the only programmer there and with only few tools I had to solve some architectural and distribution problems. The product was a suite with a couple of applications interacting with one another in order to generate micro- sites with different contents. This suite was distributed as a self-contained installation package. I left this job because my boss asked me to emit illegal receipts.</p>

      <h5 id="technologies-sourcesafe-perl-html-css-javascript"><em>Technologies: SourceSafe, Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em></h5>
      <p>My next job was at W3, a system consulting company focused on web development and maintenance for third party customers. I worked on the progressive maintenance of the website for Citibank Brasil. I participated in the site's full redesign, mainly developing components that required integration with third- party services like stock exchange tables and currency values, among others. It was my first direct experience with customers, since I often had to coordinate tasks with them. In my free time I learnt about system design principles and Java web applications development. After the site's redesign I left this company because it became boring and there was no development at all, only maintenance.</p>
      <h3 id="cda-2007---2009">CDA (2007 - 2009)</h3>
      <h5 id="technologies-svn-ant-java-ee-v1.41.6-web-services-sybase-db-ibatis-struts-jsp-html-css-javascript-flex-actionscript-3-cairngorm"><em>Technologies: SVN, Ant, Java EE (v1.4/1.6 + Web Services), Sybase DB, Ibatis, Struts, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flex (ActionScript 3, Cairngorm)</em></h5>
      <p>After leaving W3 I started working as Java programmer in CDA, an HR consulting company. I worked in the development of internal HR systems such as admissions, retirements, vacations, etc., so I learnt about HR processes. I also had the chance to bootstrap a project: a system to implement SOX controls in order to trace processes within a local bank. Once finished, I left this job because the heads of the system development area mistreated people. I learnt about technical management of development projects, gathered experience in different Java technologies, and gained expertise in the resolution of infrastructure problems such as storage, load balancing, packaging and distribution of Java applications.</p>
      <h3 id="globant-2009---2013">Globant (2009 - 2013)</h3>
      <h5 id="technologies-svn-git-maven-java-ee-mysql-jackrabbit-hibernate-spring-mvc-jawr-freemarker-yahooui-aws-imagemagick-ffmpeg"><em>Technologies: SVN, GIT, Maven, Java EE, MySQL, JackRabbit, Hibernate, Spring MVC, jawr, Freemarker, YahooUI, AWS, ImageMagick, FFMPeg</em></h5>
      <p>My next job was at Globant, another HR consulting company. I entered the company as a web developer for JWT. The project consisted in a full reengineering of a content management system. It organized digital content such as documents, images and videos, and one of the main requirements was to be able to reuse the same platform for different customers; it should be customizable and scalable so JWT could be able to resell the product to their customers. Unlike CDA where I worked with a classical request/response application model, we used a service- oriented application model in this project, so most part of the application responsibility was delegated to frontend where I was working.</p>
      <p>Here I had my first experience coordinating a development team for JWT. We started a new project to solve a problem related to JWT agencies fragmentation around the world. Agencies from different parts of the world would be able to submit creative ideas to projects, interact with people, share content and get to know other people's jobs through a social network for projects. In order to encourage participation, ideas for a project were voted by colleagues so the winner idea would be implemented. Before the beginning I had to estimate the whole effort, create the base infrastructure to let the team work on the source code and agree with the customer how we should deliver and show advances of the project. Once started, my role consisted in estimating the different components with the team, splitting them into <em>sprints</em>, talking to the customer and, of course, coding with the team and helping to solve technical issues.</p>
      <p>This project was a success and one of my most valuable experiences was that when dealing with applications with complex flows, the service-oriented programming may look like an advantage in the beginning, but maintaining an anemic domain actually is very expensive on the long run and therefore it is unfeasible for products that need a constant and long-term evolution, exceptions apart. I learnt to manage AWS services and solve complex infrastructure problems like managing distributed search indexes.</p>
      <p>After more than two years working for JWT I started to deal with a new customer of the company: 55social. The challenge was to build a social media management platform to make the content management and marketing campaings easier in social networks. Thanks to a small and excellent development team the product was online after only four months. After two years of development, the company left Globant and I continued working for 55social.</p>
      <h3 id="social-since-2013">55Social (since 2013)</h3>
      <h5 id="technologies-git-maven-java-ee-hibernate-spring-mvc-katari-elastic-search-freemarker-social-apis-facebook-twitter-google-plus-jquery-ui-histone-oocss-aws"><em>Technologies: GIT, Maven, Java EE, Hibernate, Spring MVC, <a href="https://github.com/katari/Katari">Katari</a>, Elastic Search, Freemarker, Social APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus), jQuery UI, <a href="https://github.com/MegafonWebLab/histone-javascript">Histone</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOCSS">OOCSS</a>, AWS</em></h5>
      <p>Since then I have been working at 55social, a company whose main market is digital agencies from Brazil. We chose a hybrid request/response programming model with a rich front-end without functional responsibilities. As design practices we used <em>domain driven design</em> and TDD. As organizing principles we used the Martin Fowler's Rule of Three for refactoring, the Robert Martin's <em>Single Responsibility Principle</em> and dependency injection.</p>
      <p>The work is feature-oriented and we set commitment by sprints. As feature development time may vary, we split up sprints into checkpoints so we could focus on specific aspects of the feature development and thus we were able to show concrete progress.</p>
      <p>While I was at Globant and 55social I was responsible for job interviews and I prepared both workshops and trainings.</p>
      <h3 id="software-libre">Software libre</h3>
      <p>I developed, maintained and collaborated in different free software projects during many years. The logic behind a free software organization is quite different from the business logic, so the experience managing both kind of projects helped me to develop a critical view of leadership, mainly oriented to problem resolution through collaboration. Many of the projects I started no longer exist, but there are a couple of them that still are published on Github and I would like to comment on the ones I consider more relevant.</p>
