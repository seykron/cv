          alt="My Photo" />
        <p>I was born in Mataderos, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina on
        November 13, 1987.</p>
        <p>I live in San Telmo, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
        <p>I like reading (ask me what and why!); writing my impressions about
          everything I meet; biking on sunny days; traveling! I like to
          take photos of buildings and people doing things and high contrast
          scenarios.</p>
        <p>I try to keep my mind clear, my spirit strong and my body healthy.
          That's my way for finding clever solutions to everyday's challenges.</p>
        <p>I like to participate in open source software communities. I believe
          in the freedom of open communities.</p>
        <p>I really like and appreciate simplicity. I'm self-taught.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Career Summary</h2>
        <p>I went to a technical middle school specialized in electronics.
          There I learnt the hardware basis and I used to program microcontrollers
          for school projects.</p>
        <p>During the last years in middle school I started learning web
          development in order to complement the low-level knowledge. I began as
          freelance programmer by offering institutional sites to local small
          companies. In the beginning I used PHP to build stateless
          sites and after a while when my customers required more complex
          solutions I get involved with Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since five years ago I'm focusing on frontend engineering. I worked
          on large projects since their beginning and I participated in the
          functional definition, architecture design, and often in team
          coordination. I was on teams of almost twenty people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now and since a year and a half I'm specializing in social networks
          platforms. I work on a large product that helps media companies to
          generate content in social networks, to interact with users and to
          analyze the overall campaigns engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the challenge of building high performance teams based on
          communication and people development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also a Node.js enthusiast. You can take a look at my projects on
          github :)

      <div class="section weaknesses">
        <h2 class="title">Weaknesses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Procrastination</span>: I easily lose focus when there's noise around.
            This a well-know weakness for me and I've got my strategies
            to deal with it.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Enthusiasm</span>: sounds like a strength but only what's necessary. I
            usually find myself shutting me up to listen what the other ones
            have to say.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Over-functioning</span>: sometimes I try to help everyone every time
            instead of pointing out things and let them follow a natural
            path.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Micro-management</span>: usually I think there're processes to
            cover any development lifecycle scenario. However I understand
            we all are people so we're always over processes.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section strengths">
        <h2 class="title">Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Team work</span>: I strongly encourage
            people to build a friendly environment of cooperation.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Know limits</span>: I constantly try to
            understand my own limits. I tell when something is out of my
            knowledge and then I quickly try to trepass impediments studying,
            asking, researching or delegating what's necessary.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Sense of value</span>: I've got a nice
            sense of what's worth in a given context. It helps me to take
            decisions for following the "right direction" leading software
            development.</li>
          <li><span class="soft-skill">Lateral thinking</span>: I like to deeply
            understand problems before starting solving them. I try to simplify
            not only specific problems but the whole value chain, giving place
            to any kind of solution (indeed, not everything can be addressed by
            developing software!)</li>
